* Topic = TOFU Product + attributes (one line for each product attribute the company want to feature)
* Topic = BOFU Product + attributes (one line for each product attribute the company want to feature)
* Topic= TOFU Product + location (if it makes sense. One line for each location the company wants to market to)
* Topic= BOFU Product + location (if it makes sense. One line for each location the company wants to market to)
